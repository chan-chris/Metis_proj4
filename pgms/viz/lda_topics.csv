laughing fly through the air its a can of soda have you ever be stand there and you re watch tv and you re drink the exact same product that they re advertise right there on tv and its like you know they re spike volleyball jetskie girl in bikinis and I m stand there maybe I m put too much ice in mine excited so then as we be leave we be just kind of stand there and she be sort of smile at I and I be nt sure if she want I to ask she out because when woman smile at I I do nt know what it mean sometimes I interpret it like they re psychotic or something and I do nt know if I m suppose to smile back I do nt know what to do so I just stand there like   remember how quayle look when benson give he that kennedy line that s what I look like so you do nt ask no I freeze counter oh yeah so wait

into a mental state like the karate guy before they break the brick so lloyd call I a wuss he say wuss yeah anyway he shame I into it so you call right and and to cover my nervousness I start eat an

so comfortable with each other and I could be comfortable too if I have pant like that I could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session hey I know guy like that to I the dialogue ring true even if the dialogue do ring true donna start to get annoy that jerry wo nt let the conversation go even if somehow somewhere man actually talk like that what do that have to do with the pant do nt that bother you annoyed that s the idea that s what s clever about it that they re not talk about the pant but they re talk about nothing that s the point I know the point no one be tell you to like it I mean all those quick shot of the pant just pant pant pant pant pant pant pant what be that suppose to be what s brutal about the date be the scrutiny that you put each other through because whenever you think about this person in term of the future you have to magnify everything about they you know like the guyll be like I do nt think her eyebrow be even could I

to come I need some water I get ta get some water they ll give we water in there really that s pretty good oh god its joe devola who this guy a writer he s a total nut I think he go to the same shrink as elaine oh god he see I hello jerry hey joe how you do you re under no obligation to shake my hand oh no just a custom uh that s my friend george you look good why should nt I look good oh no reason you re into karate right you want to hit I what be you do here I dreoppe a script off ah good for you well   you do nt have to say anything no uh hey I guess ill see you sunday night why kramer party kramer    have    a    party no no he s not have a party he s do something I do nt know what it be its nothing he s not do anything gee I think kramer and I be very close friend no I m sure you be I m

look you do all the talk okay relax who be they yeah they re not well than I course not who be they they re nobody what about I what about you why they why not I why not you I m as good as they well you really think so no to jerry laugh about one of his bit the bit the bit I really like what be the parakeet fly into the mirror now that s funny the parakeet in the mirror that s a good one stu yeah its one of my favorite what about you george have you write anything we might know quickly make it up well possibly I write an offbroadway show la cocina actually it be offoffbroadway it be a comedy about a mexican chef oh it be very funny there be one great scene with the chef   what be his name pepe oh pepe yeah pepe and uh he be make tamale oh he actually cook on the stage no no he mime it that s what be so funny about it so what have you two come up with well we ve think about this in a variety of way but the basic idea be I will play myself interrupting may I go ahead I think I can sum up the show for you with one word nothing nothing smile nothing unimpresse what do that mean the show be about nothing to george well its not about nothing to jerry no its about nothing well maybe in philosophy but even nothing be something mr dalrymple your niece be on the phone ill call back attempt to spell his last name dalrimpel obviously dislike george not even close be it with a y no what s the premise well as I be say I would play myself and as a comedian live in new york I have a friend a neighbor and an exgirlfriend which be all true yeah but nothing happen on the show you see its just like life you know you eat you go shop you read you eat you read you go shop you read you read on the show well I do nt know about the reading we do nt discuss the reading all right tell I tell I about the story what kind of story oh no no story no story so what be it show an example what d you do today I get up and come to work there s a show that s a show confuse how be that a show well uh maybe something happen on the way to work no no no nothing happen well something happen well why be I watch it because its on tv threaten not yet okay uh look if you want to just keep on do the same old thing then maybe this idea be not for you I for one be not go to compromise my artistic integrity and ill tell you something else this be the show and be not go to change it to jerry right to russell how about this I manage a circus I do nt even want to talk about it anymore what be you think what be go on in your mind artistic integrity where where do you come up with that you re not artistic and you have no integrity you know you really need some help a regular psychiatrist could nt even help you you need to go to like vienna or something you know what I mean you need to get involve at the university level like where freud study and have all those people look at you and check up on you that s the kind of help you need not the once a week for eighty buck no you need a team a team of psychiatrist work round the clock thinking about you have conference observe you like the way they do with the elephant man that s what I m talk about because that s the only way you re go to get well     I think the woman be kind of cute hold it I really want to be clear about this be you talk about the woman in the meeting be that the woman you re talk about yeah I think I might give she a call I I do nt meet that many woman I meet like three woman a year I mean we ve be introduce she know my name its completely inappropriate why maybe she like I I I mean she be look right at I you know I think she be impressed you know we have good eye contact the whole meeting oh I forget to call kramer wait a minute let I call susan no no this be more important she might be leave to work

probably could nt see because of the smoke yeah but it be somebodys arm hmm so you feel woman and child first in this day and age be somewhat of an antiquated notion to some degree so basically its every man woman child and invalid for themselves in a manner of speak yeah well its honest yeah she should be commend I for treat everyone like equal well perhaps when she s release from the burn center shell see thing differently perhaps so what be the fire just a couple of greasy hamburger yeah eric the clown put it out with his big shoe by the way do you see this hand george a magazine what

you want the money for the big salad george no no what be the problem there be no problem    just a small miscommunication whereby you thank she instead of the person actually responsible for purchase

elaine that even though you hand she the big salad that it come from I that s what I m suggest     well it be a big salad and what I would like to know be how do a person who have nothing to do with the big salad claim responsibility for that salad and accept the thank you under false pretense   ah   ah george all I do be hand someone a bag its just that my boss be very demanding and he need the

premise keep go at this point it be inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise she of this abhorrent turn of event continue the roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of she can not help but feel somewhat flatter by her inclusion in the unusual request a few day go by and a call be place at a time when sandy be know to be busy at work once the
