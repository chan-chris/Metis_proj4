think it would be nice if there be some kind of historical record of it uh crespi I m unbelievable at spelling last name give I a last name back off huh all right fine what be that all about for what your own show they want you to do a tv show come on how hard be that look at all the junk that s on tv you want an idea here an idea you coach gymnastic team in high school and you re married and your

get it you run an antique store and people come in the store and you get involve in their life why not I know but antique be very popular right now oh yeah like you know really I ca nt believe she get involve with a shrink so what s happen with the tv show you come up with anything why do nt they have salsa on the table salsa be now the number one condiment in america you know it must be impossible for a spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa angry I want seltzer not salsa see this should be a show this be the show this just talk I m really serious I think that s a good idea its about
