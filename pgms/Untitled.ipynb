said wuss GEORGE : yeah anyway he shamed me into it JERRY : so you called GEORGE : right and and to cover my nervousness i started eating an apple because i think if they hear you chewing on the other

off the phone right away JERRY : sure it like robbing a bank you dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money you come in you hit and get out GEORGE : it amazing we we both have date on the same night i cant remember the last time that happened GEORGE : i cant stand doing laundry thats why i have forty pair of underwear CAROL : you do not GEORGE : absolutely because

supposedly being very casual and witty DONNA : yeah thats the one JERRY : what could you possibly like about that DONNA : i dont know i like the guy JERRY : yeah theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other and i could be comfortable too if i had pant like that i could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session DONNA : hey i know guy like that to me the dialogue ring true JERRY : even if the dialogue did ring true donna start to get annoyed that jerry wont let the conversation go even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that what doe that have to do with the pant doesnt that bother you DONNA : annoyed thats the idea thats whats clever about it that theyre not talking about the pant JERRY : but theyre talking about nothing DONNA : thats the point JERRY : i know the point DONNA : no one is telling you to like it JERRY : i mean all those quick shot of the pant just pant pant pant pant pant pant pant what is that supposed to be JERRY :

it really is we want women how do we get them oh we dont know bout that we dont know the next step after that we have no idea this is why you see men honking carhorns yelling from construction sites these are the best ideas weve had so far the carhorn honk is that a beauty have you seen men doing this what is this the man is in the car the woman walks by the front of the car he honks eeeehh eehhh eehhh this man is out of ideas how does it  eeeeeeehhhh i dont think she likes me the amazing thing is that we still get women dont we men i mean men are with women you see men with women how are men getting women many people wonder let me tell you a little bit about our organization wherever women are we have a man working on the situation right now now he may not be our best man okay we have a lot of areas to cover but someone from our staff is on the scene thats why i think men get frustrated when we see women reading articles like where to meet men were here we are everywhere were honking our horns to serve you better JERRY: so im on line at the supermarket two women in front of me one of them her total was eight dollars the other three dollars they both of course choose to pay by the

book comes out of a holster jerry draws imaginary book from a holster who do i make it out to theres my id theres something about a cheque that to a man is not masculine i dont know exactly what it is

have any money but i have these i wrote on these is this of any value at all JERRY: whats that one ELAINE: coccoon ii the return i guess they didnt like it up there JERRY: maybe they came back for

that the way its supposed to work i mean you could just give someone the toe really couldnt you i would feel worse if i got the toe than if i got the finger cause its not easy to give someone the toe

something was their fault thats what i want i want an admission of guilt DRY CLEANER: maybe you asked for it to be washed JERRY: no drycleaned DRY CLEANE: let me explain to you something okay with certain types of fabrics different chemicals can react causing JERRY: you shrunk it you know you shrunk it just tell me that you shrunk it DRY CLEANER: looks around making sure not too many people are listening i shrunk it JERRY: i think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so i can say to the dry cleaner well its ruined and of course the dry cleaner can respond its not our fault were not responsible we just ruin the clothes that ends our legal obligation you see the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible thright theyre cleaning our clothes but theyre not getting anything wet its all dry i know theres gotta be some liquids back there some fluids that theyre using theres no such thing as dry cleaning when you get something on your shirt ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that jerry brushes off his shirt thats dry cleaning i dont think thats what theyre doing back there they dont have eighty guys going

      "JERRY: the bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing you ever see anybody on tv like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face some people have a little too much fun on television the soda commercial people where do they summon this enthusiasm have you seen them we have soda we have soda we have soda jumping laughing flying through the air its a can of soda have you ever been standing there and youre watching tv and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on tv and its like you know theyre spiking volleyballs jetskiing girls in bikinis and im standing there maybe im putting too much ice in mine GEORGE: excited so then as we were leaving we were just kind of standing there and she was sort of smiling at me and i wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out because when women smile at me i dont know what it means sometimes i interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and i dont know if im supposed to smile back i dont know what to do so i just stood there like  remember how quayle looked when benson gave him that kennedy line thats what i looked like JERRY: so you didnt ask GEORGE: no i froze JERRY: counter GEORGE: oh yeah so wait wait a halfhour later im back in the office i tell lloyd the whole story he says so why dont

JERRY: he said wuss GEORGE: yeah anyway he shamed me into it JERRY: so you called GEORGE: right and and to cover my nervousness i started eating an apple because i think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone it makes you sound casual JERRY: yeah like a farm boy GEORGE: right so i call her up i tell her its me she gives me an enthusiastic hi JERRY: wow the enthusiastic hi thats

dont know what to say to reassure this woman and worst of all i dont have the time to say it the only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if i told her i am in reality batman and im very sorry

movements theres nothing else i can do thats why i like to wear a belt when im naked cause i feel it gives me something i know im naked but you know tugging and lifting belt i like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be wouldnt that be the ultimate to be naked and still be able to do this hand in pocket i think that would really help a lot JERRY: a mental institution KRAMER: you

nervous about this ive never spoken to a mental patient before JERRY: my cousin douglas was in a place like this one time  he came over to my house for dinner there was no soda and he went bezerk he

makes it seem like you have an entire other room what kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes hey look theres a whole nother room in there theres a guy in there looks just like me but the parakeet will fall for this youll let him out of his cage he flies around the room bang with his little head he would just go click ohh and id always think even if he thinks the mirror is another room why doesnt he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet\n"
